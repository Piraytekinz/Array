        Privacy Policy
        Effective Date: [09/06/2025]

        Welcome to Array ("we", "our", or "us"). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our AI-based tool that transforms images into a digital rain Matrix-like effect (the "Service").

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Uploaded Images
                        To generate the digital rain effect, our AI requires image input. Images uploaded by users are processed either locally or on secure servers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Automatically Collected Data
                        When you access our Service, we may automatically collect certain information such as:
                        IP address
                        Browser type
                        Device information
                        Usage data (e.g., time spent on the site, interactions)
                        This helps us improve the functionality and user experience.

                How We Use Your Information
                We use your information solely to:
                Process your image and generate the visual effect
                Improve and maintain our Service
                Ensure security and prevent misuse
                Analyze anonymized usage trends
                We do not use your images for training AI models or any other purpose without explicit user consent.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use of Google Authenticator
                To enhance account security, our Service may use Google Authenticator or other time-based one-time password (TOTP) apps to enable two-factor authentication (2FA). This additional security layer helps protect your account from unauthorized access.

                When you enable Google Authenticator:
                <ul>
                    <li>We generate a secure, time-based token that you can scan or enter into the app.</li>
                    <li>We do not collect, transmit, or store your verification codes or secret keys.</li>
                    <li>The verification process occurs locally and is only used to confirm your identity when logging in or performing sensitive operations.</li>
                    <li>Your use of Google Authenticator is entirely optional but strongly recommended for enhanced account protection.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Google API Disclosure
                If you sign in or connect your Google account via OAuth for authentication purposes, please note:
                <ul>
                    <li>We use your Google email and basic profile information strictly for account identification and login.</li>
                    <li>We do not read, modify, or store any other personal data from your Google account.</li>
                    <li>Our app complies with Google's API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.</li>
                    <li>You can revoke access at any time via your Google Account's security settings: https://myaccount.google.com/permissions</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
